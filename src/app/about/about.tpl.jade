    | The Elevator Pitch
    small For the lazy and impatient.

  p.
    <code>ng-boilerplate</code> is an opinionated kickstarter for web
    development projects. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new
    web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to
    have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has
    slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure
    to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied together with a robust
    build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.

  h2 Why?

  p.
    Because my team and I make web apps, and
    last year AngularJS became our client-side framework of choice. We start
    websites the same way every time: create a directory structure, copy and
    ever-so-slightly tweak some config files from an older project, and yada
    yada, etc., and so on and so forth. Why are we repeating ourselves? We wanted a starting point; a set of
    best practices that we could identify our projects as embodying and a set of
    time-saving wonderfulness, because time is money.
